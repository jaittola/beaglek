Beaglek is a simple user interface for a SignalK (http://signalk.org/)
marine data server. Beaglek is intended for low-resolution
displays like a BeagleBoard Black with a 7" display cape. The minimum
supported resolution is 480x272.

Beaglek will run as an extension of the SignalK server. The details 
are still open.
